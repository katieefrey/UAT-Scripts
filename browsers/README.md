This contains the files for the the alphabetical, hierarchical, and dendrogram browsers of the UAT.  Additionally need the html and json conversion scripts found in the scripts folder.

d3.v3.js is a modified version of the standard D3.js javascript library code that removes the mouse-wheel interaction.  This just an inelegant way to remove some of the mouse-wheel functionality that I did not want to have on the dendrogram.  D3.js is written and maintined by Michael Bostock (http://d3js.org/).
